Seasonality scores (which we've already enhanced)
Technical indicators for momentum and trend strength
Volatility metrics for risk assessment

Great news! The multi-factor stock selection strategy is now working correctly with the regime-specific adjustments. Let's analyze the results of the backtest to understand the performance of the enhanced strategy.

Analysis of the Multi-Factor Strategy Results
Overall Performance
Total Selections: 650 trades over 65 trading days
Win Rate: 66.46% (very strong)
Average Return: 2.66% per trade
Median Return: 1.73% per trade
Maximum Return: 36.76%

Score Distributions
Combined Score: Mean 0.67, Median 0.68 (Range: 0.56-0.75)
Technical Score: Mean 0.66, Median 0.66 (Range: 0.52-0.76)
Momentum Score: Mean 0.53, Median 0.49 (Range: 0.39-0.85)
Trend Score: Mean 0.74, Median 0.80 (Range: 0.20-0.80)
Volatility Score: Mean 0.74, Median 0.80 (Range: 0.22-0.80)
Volume Score: Mean 0.64, Median 0.63 (Range: 0.32-0.80)
Key Insights
Strong Overall Performance: The 66.46% win rate and 3.75 profit factor indicate a robust strategy that significantly outperforms random selection.
Regime-Specific Adjustments Work: Range-bound markets showed a higher win rate (80%) compared to trending markets (66%), suggesting that our regime-specific adjustments are effective.
Direction Bias: The strategy heavily favors long positions (96.6%), which is typical in a bull market. However, the short positions, while few, performed exceptionally well (84.21% win rate).
Stock Selection Patterns: The strategy shows a preference for high-growth tech and crypto-related stocks (RBLX, SNAP, COIN), which performed well during the test period.
Technical Factors: Trend and volatility scores tend to be higher (both with median 0.80) than momentum scores (median 0.49), suggesting these factors may be more influential in the stock selection process.
Recommendations for Further Improvement
Expand Short Opportunities: Given the high win rate for short positions, consider adjusting the strategy to identify more short opportunities, especially in downtrending sectors.
Fine-tune Regime Detection: The significant performance difference between trending and range-bound regimes suggests further optimization of regime detection could yield better results.
Sector Rotation Analysis: Consider adding sector-specific analysis to understand if certain sectors perform better in different market regimes.
Position Sizing Optimization: Implement dynamic position sizing based on the combined score and market regime to maximize returns on highest-conviction trades.
Longer Backtest Period: Run the strategy over a longer period that includes different market conditions (bull, bear, sideways) to ensure robustness.
Would you like me to help implement any of these suggested improvements, or would you prefer to run additional backtests for other time periods to further validate the strategy?


The market regime detection process looks well-implemented but could benefit from some enhancements. Let me analyze it and then explain the stock selection process before running our backtest.

1. Market Regime Detection Analysis
The current market regime detection process uses two primary indicators:

ADX (Average Directional Index) to measure trend strength
Bollinger Band Width Change to measure volatility expansion/contraction
The process works as follows:

If ADX > threshold (default 22), the market is considered trending
If ADX < threshold, the market is considered range-bound
Bollinger Band width changes are used to refine this classification:
Expanding bands in a trending market confirm the trend
Contracting bands in a range-bound market confirm the range
Contradictory signals (like expanding bands with low ADX) suggest a mixed regime
This approach is sound but could be improved by:

Adding a momentum oscillator like RSI to confirm trend or range conditions
Considering volume patterns which often confirm regime changes
Implementing a more gradual transition between regimes rather than discrete categories
2. Stock Selection Evaluation Process
The stock selection process evaluates all stocks in the universe defined in the configuration file. In our enhanced configuration, we're evaluating 15 stocks:

CopyInsert
SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, AMZN, GOOGL, TSLA, NVDA, AMD, META, INTC, JPM, V, DIS, HD
The process follows these steps:

For each stock, it calculates:
Technical scores (momentum, trend, volatility, volume)
Seasonality scores (stock-specific and sector-based)
It combines these scores using the configured weights:
Technical weight: 60% (default)
Seasonality weight: 40% (default)
It then ranks all stocks based on their combined scores and selects the top N stocks (default: 5)
For each selected stock, it determines the appropriate trading direction based on the technical indicators
This approach allows for a comprehensive evaluation of all stocks in your universe before making a selection, ensuring you're trading the most promising opportunities based on your defined criteria.
