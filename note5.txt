I've made several significant improvements to your multi-strategy trading system to optimize performance based on our previous analysis. Let me explain the key changes:

1. Enhanced Strategy Weighting and Configuration
I've updated the multi_strategy_config.yaml file with optimized parameters:

Adjusted strategy weights: Increased Mean Reversion weight to 60% (from 35%) and Trend Following to 30% (from 25%) while reducing the weights of Volatility Breakout and Gap Trading to 5% each based on their historical performance.
Improved risk management: Reduced max open positions from 10 to 8 for better capital allocation and lowered the max portfolio risk from 2.0% to 1.5% for improved risk control.
Enhanced signal quality filters: Increased the minimum score threshold from 0.6 to 0.7 to focus on higher quality signals and reduced max signals per day from 10 to 8.
Optimized trend following parameters: Set fast EMA period to 8 and slow EMA period to 21, lowered ADX threshold to 20, and added parameters for minimum trend strength (0.15) and consecutive confirming bars (2).
2. Improved Signal Combination Logic
The _combine_signals method in combined_strategy_backtest.py now:

Applies symbol-specific weight multipliers to strategy weights
Converts signal strength to numerical values for better filtering
Calculates a signal score based on strength and strategy weight
Sorts signals by score (highest first) then by timestamp
Filters signals based on minimum score threshold
Limits the number of signals per day according to configuration
3. Enhanced Position Sizing Logic
The position sizing logic now:

Uses risk-based position sizing based on stop loss distance
Adjusts risk based on signal strength and strategy type
Applies stock-specific risk adjustments
Enforces position size limits as a percentage of available capital
Ensures positions are sized appropriately for the risk profile
4. Improved Trade Execution and Exit Logic
The trade execution and exit logic now:

Performs better checks for capital availability and position limits
Prevents conflicting positions in opposite directions
Implements strategy-specific exit conditions:
For Mean Reversion: Exits when price reverts back to the mean (1% profit)
For Trend Following: Implements a trailing stop based on ATR
Calculates and tracks profit/loss more accurately
5. Enhanced Performance Tracking
The equity curve calculation and performance metrics now:

Tracks capital, positions value, and total portfolio value
Calculates drawdown more accurately
Provides detailed performance metrics including:
Total return and annualized return
Sharpe ratio
Maximum drawdown
Win rate and profit factor
Strategy-specific metrics (win rates and profits)
These improvements should significantly enhance the performance of your trading system by:

Focusing more on the better-performing strategies (Mean Reversion and Trend Following)
Selecting higher quality signals with better filtering
Implementing more effective risk management
Using strategy-specific exit conditions to maximize profits
Providing better performance tracking for ongoing optimization
