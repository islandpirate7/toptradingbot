To fix the "'NoneType' object is not iterable" error in your multi-strategy trading system, you need to modify the code in multi_strategy_system.py around line 2500.

Find this code section:

```python
# Generate signals
new_signals = strategy.generate_signals(
    symbol=symbol,
    candles=stock_data[:current_idx],
    stock_config=stock_config,
    market_state=self.market_state
)

# Add strategy weight to signal metadata
for signal in new_signals:
    signal.metadata["strategy_weight"] = self.strategy_weights.get(name, 0.25)

# Add to signals list
self.signals.extend(new_signals)
```

And replace it with:

```python
# Generate signals
new_signals = strategy.generate_signals(
    symbol=symbol,
    candles=stock_data[:current_idx],
    stock_config=stock_config,
    market_state=self.market_state
)

# Add strategy weight to signal metadata
if new_signals is not None:
    for signal in new_signals:
        signal.metadata["strategy_weight"] = self.strategy_weights.get(name, 0.25)
    
    # Add to signals list
    self.signals.extend(new_signals)
```

This change adds a check to ensure that new_signals is not None before trying to iterate over it, which will prevent the error.
