Great! The backtest has successfully run using our mock data generator. Let's analyze the results:

Backtest Results Summary
The enhanced mean reversion strategy performed well in our mock backtest for Q1 2023:

Total Trades: 1
Win Rate: 100.00%
Profit Factor: Infinite (no losing trades)
Total PnL: $809.71
Maximum Drawdown: 0.00%
Return: 0.81%
While these results look promising, it's important to note that we're using mock data rather than actual market data. The mock data generator creates price movements with some built-in mean reversion characteristics, which might favor our strategy.

Next Steps
Based on your previous optimization work with the mean reversion strategy, we should consider:

Run with Real Data: Once we resolve the Alpaca API authentication issues, we should run the backtest with real historical data from 2023 to get more accurate results.
Apply Optimized Parameters: Your optimized configuration (BB period: 20, BB std dev: 1.9, RSI thresholds: 35/65) should be used for all future backtests.
Test Across Multiple Quarters: As you've done previously, testing across different quarters of 2023 would provide a more comprehensive view of strategy performance.
Combine with Trend Following: The multi-strategy approach combining mean reversion with trend following could provide more robust performance across different market conditions.
Would you like me to:

Modify the script to use your optimized parameters from the final configuration?
Try to resolve the Alpaca API authentication issues to run with real data?
Expand the test to include the trend following strategy as well?
