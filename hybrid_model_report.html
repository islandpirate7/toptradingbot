                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    The hybrid trading model combines the strengths of the original and optimized configurations
                    while addressing their respective weaknesses. By implementing enhanced position sizing,
                    dynamic risk management, and improved signal filtering, the hybrid model is expected to
                    deliver superior risk-adjusted returns across various market conditions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Further optimization opportunities include fine-tuning the strategy weights based on
                    real-world performance data and implementing machine learning-based signal quality
                    assessment to further reduce false signals.
