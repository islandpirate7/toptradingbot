Analysis of S&P 500 Strategy Optimization
1. Sector-Based Signal Prioritization
The strategy uses a sophisticated signal prioritization system in the prioritize_signals() method that incorporates sector performance in several ways:

Sector Weights Configuration
Sector weights are defined in sp500_config.yaml based on historical win rates:
Communication Services: 2.0 (82.76% win rate)
Industrials: 1.8 (77.50% win rate)
Technology: 1.5 (69.77% win rate)
Utilities: 1.5 (69.64% win rate)
Financials: 1.4 (68.93% win rate)
Healthcare: 1.4 (68.35% win rate)
Consumer Discretionary: 1.3 (67.86% win rate)
Materials: 1.2 (64.86% win rate)
Energy: 1.1 (62.50% win rate)
Consumer Staples: 1.1 (60.94% win rate)
Real Estate: 0.8 (47.06% win rate)
Signal Priority Calculation
The prioritization algorithm:

Starts with the base signal score
Applies sector weight multiplier to the priority score
Adds boosts for signals aligned with sector trends:
LONG signals in bullish sectors get +0.1 boost
LONG signals in strongly bullish sectors get additional +0.1
SHORT signals in bearish sectors get +0.1 boost
SHORT signals in strongly bearish sectors get additional +0.1
Adds boosts for signals aligned with market trends:
LONG signals in bullish market get +0.05
SHORT signals in bearish market get +0.05
Strongly favors LONG signals with +0.15 boost (based on backtest results showing LONG signals outperform)
Penalizes signals that go against strong trends:
LONG signals in strongly bearish sectors get -0.15 penalty
SHORT signals in strongly bullish sectors get -0.15 penalty
The signals are then sorted by priority score (highest first) to determine execution order.

2. Sector Weights in Position Sizing
The calculate_position_size() method incorporates sector weights into position sizing calculations:

Tiered Position Sizing
Base position size: $10,000
Tier multipliers from config:
Tier 1 (score ≥ 0.9): 2.5x base position size
Tier 2 (score 0.8-0.9): 1.5x base position size
Tier 3 (score 0.7-0.8): 1.0x base position size
Tier 4 (score < 0.7): 0.75x base position size
Direction Multipliers
LONG positions: 1.5x multiplier
SHORT positions: 1.0x multiplier (base allocation)
Sector Weight Application
The sector weight from the configuration is applied as an additional multiplier to the position size
This means sectors with higher historical win rates receive larger position sizes
For example, a signal in Communication Services (2.0 weight) would receive twice the position size of a similar signal in Real Estate (0.8 weight)
Position Size Caps
Maximum 10% of available buying power per position
Minimum position size of $500
3. Performance Metrics by Tier
The strategy tracks performance metrics by signal tier to validate the tiered position sizing approach:

Tier Performance Analysis
Tier 1 (≥0.9) signals: 70.00% win rate, $509.45 average P/L
Tier 2 (0.8-0.9) signals: 47.06% win rate, $76.60 average P/L
Tier 3 (0.7-0.8) signals: 33.33% win rate, $0.77 average P/L
Direction-Specific Performance
LONG signals consistently outperform SHORT signals
Tier 1 LONG signals: 80.85% win rate (94 trades)
SHORT signals perform best in Tier 2: 41.94% win rate (62 trades)
4. Validation of the Approach
The backtest results validate the effectiveness of the sector-based optimization:

Tiered Position Sizing Validation: Tier 1 signals generate approximately 6.7x more profit per trade than Tier 2 signals, confirming that allocating more capital to stronger signals is effective.
Sector Weight Effectiveness: The sector weights based on historical win rates help allocate more capital to sectors where the strategy performs better.
Overall Performance: Combined results across 4 quarters show:
60.00% win rate
2.94 profit factor
LONG signals: 82.00% win rate
SHORT signals: 38.00% win rate
200 total trades (120 winning, 80 losing)
5. Key Insights
Sector Performance Matters: The strategy recognizes that performance varies significantly across sectors, with Communication Services having the highest win rate (82.76%) and Real Estate the lowest (47.06%).
Signal Strength Correlation: Higher signal scores (Tier 1) strongly correlate with better performance, justifying the tiered position sizing approach.
LONG vs SHORT Asymmetry: LONG signals consistently outperform SHORT signals, which is reflected in the direction multipliers (1.5x for LONG vs 1.0x for SHORT).
Trend Alignment: Signals aligned with sector and market trends receive priority boosts, improving overall strategy performance.
This sector-based optimization approach has successfully refined the S&P 500 trading strategy by incorporating historical sector performance into both signal prioritization and position sizing, leading to improved risk-adjusted returns.
