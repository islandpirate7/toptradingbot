## Usage

### Running the Strategy

```bash
# Run the strategy in paper trading mode
python run_paper_trading.py --max_signals 20 --duration 1 --interval 5

# Run a market simulation
python run_market_simulation.py --days 30 --capital 100000 --max_signals 20 --interval 5

# Run multiple backtests
python run_comprehensive_backtest.py --quarters "2023Q1,2023Q2,2023Q3,2023Q4" --runs 5 --random_seed 42
```

### Web Interface

The trading system includes a web interface for easy control and monitoring:

```bash
# Start the web interface
cd web_interface
python app.py
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser to access the interface.

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- alpaca-trade-api
- pandas
- numpy
- tqdm
- flask (for web interface)
- pyyaml

## Setup

1. Create an `alpaca_credentials.json` file with your API keys:

```json
{
    "paper": {
        "api_key": "YOUR_PAPER_API_KEY",
        "api_secret": "YOUR_PAPER_API_SECRET",
        "base_url": "https://paper-api.alpaca.markets/v2"
    },
    "live": {
        "api_key": "YOUR_LIVE_API_KEY",
        "api_secret": "YOUR_LIVE_API_SECRET",
        "base_url": "https://api.alpaca.markets"
    }
}
```

2. Install the required packages:

```bash
pip install alpaca-trade-api pandas numpy tqdm flask pyyaml
```

## Strategy Optimization

The strategy has been optimized based on extensive backtesting. Key optimizations include:

1. **LONG-Only Approach**: Switched to LONG-only strategy for improved stability and performance
2. **Multiple Backtests**: Runs multiple backtests with different random seeds for more reliable results
3. **Adaptive Stop Loss**: Implements stop loss mechanisms that adapt to market conditions
4. **Mid-Cap Integration**: Balances between large-cap and mid-cap stocks for improved diversification
5. **Signal Quality Assessment**: Prioritizes signals based on technical score and market conditions

## Deployment

The system can be deployed to Vercel for easy access and management:

1. Push the repository to GitHub
2. Connect your Vercel account to your GitHub repository
3. Configure the deployment settings in Vercel
4. Deploy the application

## Emergency Procedures

The system includes safety mechanisms for handling unexpected shutdowns:

1. All open positions are logged to CSV files
2. The web interface includes an emergency stop button that closes all positions
3. The `handle_shutdown.py` script can be run to safely close all positions in case of system failure
